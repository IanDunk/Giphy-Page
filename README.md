# Giphy-Page
A webpage that displays the top 10 gifs by description of your choice


Needs to switch gif from playing at first to paused
Need to make gifs the same size (I believe it's already a key with a url on the response)
Change animals to gifs
Make every gif the same height so they line up nicely in each row


// var queryURL = "https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/random?api_key=dc6zaTOxFJmzC&tag=cats"; !!!
// personImage.attr("src", results[i].images.fixed_height.url); !!!
